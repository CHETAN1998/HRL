S.Y. COMP (S1)
PROJECT NAME : COMPRESION

	I have done 3 compression types they are as follows:
[1] :HUFFMAN COMPRESSION->
	COMPRESSION RATIO ~ 40% i.e. 100mb file will compress upto approx be 60mb.
	It contains calculating freq. table, building huffman tree, bitwise operations and then decompressing compressed file again.
[2] :RLE COMPRESSION->
	COMPRESSION RATIO is variable depending on in what amount data in text file is repeated.
	It just stores character and its freq. continuously in compressed file.
	Generally preffered for small text files.
[3]:LZW COMPRESSION:->
	COMPRESSION RATIO ~ 45%(large text file)(still it depends on amount of repetitiveness of words)
	Firstly 256 characters are stored in dictionary, then new words are added until EOF.
